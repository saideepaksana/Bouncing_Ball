## üé® Features

- **Gravity**  
  The ball accelerates downward, tracing natural parabolic arcs.

- **Elastic Collisions**  
  Perfectly bouncy impacts‚Äîno energy loss on contact.

- **Rotating Hexagon**  
  The six-sided boundary spins at a constant angular speed, changing bounce angles in real time.

- **Spark Particles**  
  Tiny, fading sparks emit from the contact point on each collision.
