# Rotating Hexagon Bouncing Ball

A Pygame demo of a purple-violet ball falling under gravity inside a continuously rotating hexagon, with spark particles on every bounce.

## 🎨 Features

- **Gravity**  
  The ball accelerates downward, tracing natural parabolic arcs.

- **Elastic Collisions**  
  Perfectly bouncy impacts—no energy loss on contact.

- **Rotating Hexagon**  
  The six-sided boundary spins at a constant angular speed, changing bounce angles in real time.

- **Spark Particles**  
  Tiny, fading sparks emit from the contact point on each collision.
